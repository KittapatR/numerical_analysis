*August 2021, Kittapat Ratanaphupha*

Numerical Methods that mentioned in MTH 264 at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi

In this repository, mentioned numerical methods are as the following:
1. Solution to Non-Linear Equations (Root finding algorithm)
2. Solving Linear System
3. Curve Fitting Algorithms and Polynomial Interpolation
4. Numerical Integration
5. Initial Value Problem

This repository considers a numerical method in two perspectives. First, theoretical analysis will consider about rate of convergence, time complexity, and related theorem w/ necessary proofs. Second, computational analysis will consider the algorithm and implementations in Python script as available in .ipynb for each chapter.
